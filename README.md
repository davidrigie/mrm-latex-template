Magnetic Resonance in Medicine LaTeX template (from Overleaf.com)

This comes from Overleaf.com. Manuscripts can be created directly in the browser on Overleaf and submitted to MRM. This is an officially supported mechanism for submission. For those interested in using their own tools for compilation/editing etc, this is a good starting template.
